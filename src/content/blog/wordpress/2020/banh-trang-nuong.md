Vietnam is famous for its incredible street food!

Today, let's discover how to prepare "Bánh Tráng Nướng", the rice paper pizza! This street food is not really traditional and attract mostly young kids/teenagers in Vietnam.  
No wonder why it does not represent the "healthy diet" that traditional Vietnamese dishes offer. For that reason, don't abuse from it and consider bringing enough plant based food in your daily diet! ;-)

Hope you enjoy!
