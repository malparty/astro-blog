My work required me to learn — quickly — new languages. This end of 2021, is around [Go](https://go.dev/). You know, this fun blue pet from Google that aims to provide a refreshed codding experience while remaining close to the machine as the C language!

Well, moving from Ruby and Typescript with React, I should say that the rawness of Go is a big slap in your face! I could keep a long list of complaints but at the same time, I know that it is also a matter of "get into it for real".

So instead of spending time explaining why I do not like Go, I've decided to force myself to use it — in a failsafe and fun environment of course!

It has been a long time since I wanted to code something related to Audio. I love the universe of DAWless music macking. I'm not devoted enough to learn playing the piano or guitar, but I love so much to jam on my [Digitakt](https://www.elektron.se/products/digitakt/).

Most of [the audio projects in GitHub](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/synthesizer) are C++. Considering most audio standards from the 90s have been created in C++ at that time, it is sort of a legacy from the past. I did not want to be in there. But on the other hand, I did not want to face performance issues if the project will need to scale. So a Web app in TypeScript or some other modern languages seemed at a too high level of abstraction.

That is where Go and music entered into the game!

Wish me good luck!
