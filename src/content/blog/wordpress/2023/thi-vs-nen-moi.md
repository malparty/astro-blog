"Thì" and "nên mới" are both conjunctions in Vietnamese, but they are used in different contexts and convey different meanings.

1. **"Thì":**

   - "Thì" is a conjunction used to express a cause-and-effect relationship or a temporal sequence. It's similar to the English conjunction "then" or "so." You use "thì" to connect two clauses where one action or event is the result or consequence of the other.
     - Example: "Tôi đã học nhiều, thì tôi đã đỗ kỳ thi." (I studied a lot, so I passed the exam.)
     - Example: "Anh ấy đã đi công tác, thì gia đình anh ấy ở nhà." (He went on a business trip, so his family stayed at home.)

2. **"Nên mới":**
   - "Nên mới" is used to express a logical relationship, indicating a reason or explanation for a certain situation or action. It suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, but with an emphasis on the logical or necessary connection between the two events.
     - Example: "Anh ta rất giàu, nên mới có thể mua chiếc xe đắt tiền đó." (He is very wealthy, so that's why he can afford that expensive car.)
     - Example: "Cô ấy rất nhiệt tình, nên mới được chọn làm trưởng nhóm." (She is very enthusiastic, so that's why she was chosen to be the team leader.)

In summary:

- Use "thì" to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship or a temporal sequence.

- Use "nên mới" to emphasize a logical reason or explanation for a situation or action.
