# Corrections

**Do say: 'ngủ ngon'.**  
Do NOT say 'ngủ khỏe'!

**Do say: 'tôi', 'mính', 'anh/em', ...**  
Do NOT say 'tao' – used for extremely close friends, or when shouting with anger. 😬

**Do say: 'sau mười phút'.**  
Do NOT say 'sau khi mười phút' – 'sau khi + event, ...' is used with an event/action!

**Do say: 'năm ngoái'** – last year  
Do NOT say 'năm trước' – the previous year 🫣

**Do say: 'chị đã sắp xếp được thời gian'**  
Do NOT say 'chị đã được sắp xếp thời gian'

# Pronunciation

**ư:** You need to smile with your teeth closed and pronounce the French 'Euh'.

**Xù:** Descending ton in Vietnamese is longer than the Chinese one. Practice by bending your head down during the vowel emission.

# Main improvement areas

- My vowel pronunciation is bad.

- I should not pronounce the ending consonants.

- My vocabulary is misused:

  - Words used in the wrong context.
  - Overcomplexification (e.g. '1991' instead of just '91', no need to use complete subject + verb when the interlocutor is not using it, adding 'khi' to 'sau mười phút', etc.).

- French accent is too nasal – I still need to understand this part 🙈 An example word is 'nga'.

# Learning habits to adopt

📝 When I want to express something (at work, at home, etc.) but face some difficulties, I should not it down so I can bring the topic to the class.

⏱️ Minimum 15 minutes of practice **every** day.  
💡 Aim for 30min morning and 30 minutes after lunch.
