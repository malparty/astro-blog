"Bày tỏ" and "biểu hiện" are both Vietnamese verbs that can be used to describe how someone expresses something, but they have slightly different meanings.

"Bày tỏ" means "to express" or "to convey" something through words or actions. It implies that there is an intention to communicate a message or feeling to someone else. For example:

- Tôi muốn bày tỏ lòng biết ơn của mình đến cô giáo. (I want to express my gratitude to the teacher.)

On the other hand, "biểu hiện" means "to manifest" or "to exhibit" something through behavior, actions, or physical signs. It describes how someone's emotions, thoughts, or feelings are displayed through their actions, body language, or facial expressions, without necessarily implying an intention to communicate. For example:

- Cô ấy biểu hiện rõ ràng rằng cô đang lo lắng về điểm số. (She's clearly showing that she's worried about her grades.)

In summary, "bày tỏ" is used to describe intentional expression through words or actions, while "biểu hiện" is used to describe the way someone's emotions or thoughts are displayed through behavior, actions, or physical signs, regardless of whether there is an intention to communicate.
