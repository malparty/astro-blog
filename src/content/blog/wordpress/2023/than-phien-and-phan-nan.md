"Than phiền" and "phàn nàn" are two similar Vietnamese words that both mean "to complain". However, there are some subtle differences in their usage and connotations:

- "Than phiền" generally refers to expressing dissatisfaction or annoyance about a minor issue, such as a small inconvenience or discomfort. It is often used in a polite or apologetic manner, and may imply a sense of resignation or acceptance that the situation cannot be changed.
- "Phàn nàn", on the other hand, tends to convey a stronger sense of discontent or dissatisfaction about a more serious or significant issue, such as a problem or injustice that requires attention or action. It can also be used in a more forceful or confrontational manner, and may imply a desire for resolution or redress.

In summary, "than phiền" is used for expressing mild complaints or grievances, while "phàn nàn" is used for more serious or substantial complaints or objections. However, the exact usage and connotations of these words can vary depending on the context and tone of the speaker.
