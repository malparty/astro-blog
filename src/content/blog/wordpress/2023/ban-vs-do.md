1. **"Bẩn":** This word generally refers to something that is physically dirty or unclean. It can describe objects, surfaces, or places that are not clean. For example, if a shirt has mud on it, you could say "áo bẩn" (dirty shirt). This term is more commonly used for things and places rather than people.

2. **"Dơ":** "Dơ" can also mean dirty, but it often implies a sense of being grimy or soiled. It can be used for both physical dirtiness and a more metaphorical, moral kind of dirtiness. For instance, "tay dơ" can mean dirty hands (physically dirty hands) or be used metaphorically to imply someone is involved in dishonest activities.

In everyday conversation, these words can sometimes be interchangeable, especially when referring to physical dirtiness. However, the choice of word might convey slightly different nuances depending on the context.
