"Hoài bão" and "tham vọng" both relate to aspirations or ambitions, but they carry different nuances:

1. **"Hoài bão":** This term refers to one's dreams, ideals, or long-term aspirations. It often implies a sense of idealism, something that one hopes for in the future. "Hoài bão" reflects deep-seated, often noble, and sometimes unrealistic aspirations. It's about the things one passionately dreams of achieving in their life. For example, "hoài bão của anh ấy là xây trường cho trẻ em nghèo" means "his dream is to build schools for underprivileged children."

2. **"Tham vọng":** This phrase translates to "ambition" in English. "Tham vọng" refers to a strong desire for success, power, or achievement. It often implies a more pragmatic and sometimes competitive approach towards reaching one's goals. Unlike "hoài bão," which can have a more romantic or idealistic tone, "tham vọng" is often associated with a person's determined pursuit of their goals, sometimes regardless of the means used to achieve them.

In summary, "hoài bão" encompasses deeply cherished dreams and ideals, often with a touch of idealism, while "tham vọng" refers to ambitious desires and goals, typically characterized by determination and often pragmatism.
